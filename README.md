With a simple click, we’ll serve up an image of a cup of coffee to inspire your next caffeine fix. Don’t like what you see? Refresh until you find your perfect brew.

## 🛠️ How to Install Brew What?
You can run the site locallly using Live Server in VS Code:
Install the Live Server extension.

Right-click index.html > click Open with Live Server.

OR

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alison089/brew-what.git
   cd brew-what

## Running Tests
No automated tests are currently implemented. All functionality is verified manually through browser interaction.

Future developers are encouraged to implement unit tests using Jest or browser testing with Cypress.

## 📡 API Overview
We utilize a third-party coffee image API to generate random coffee images.

External API (used in main.js)
GET https://coffee.alexflipnote.dev/random.json

Returns: a JSON object containing a URL to a random coffee image.

Example response:

{
  "file": "https://coffee.alexflipnote.dev/KXc99IJ6iRM_coffee.jpg"
}

As well as our Nutrition Tracker API
GET /api/nutrition-data


## Known Bugs
Image occasionally fails to load if API rate limit is exceeded.

No image caching – reloading quickly may repeat images.


## Roadmap for Future Development
Add coffee descriptions or names to each image

Add voice command support using Annyang (e.g., “Show me another!”)

Improve mobile responsiveness and add animations

Add loading spinner while fetching coffee image

Build out user profile feature (track saved drinks, preferences)
